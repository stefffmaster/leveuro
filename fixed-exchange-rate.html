  <h1>Understanding the Fixed Lev ↔ Euro Exchange Rate</h1>
  <p>The lev is pegged to the euro under a currency board arrangement, and the fixed rate is <strong>1 EUR = 1.95583 BGN</strong>. This rate has remained stable for years.</p>

  <h2>Why is the rate fixed?</h2>
  <p>The fixed rate helps keep inflation and currency volatility low in Bulgaria as it transitions to the euro.</p>

  <h2>Will the rate change in 2026?</h2>
  <p>No — the same rate will be used when Bulgaria enters the eurozone.</p>
